# web-bootstrap

Bootstrap your site development. Great for building small sites and simple prototypes.

## Requirements

* [node](https://nodejs.org) (v4.4.x)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v2.14.x)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the created directory
3. Run `npm install`

## Quick Start

After the install has completed, run `gulp` to launch a local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes you make to `html`, `scss`, and `js` files will compile the respective assets and refresh the page automatically.

## Gulp Commands

* `gulp` - Builds the project and launches a local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* `gulp build` - Builds the project
* `gulp build:dist` - Builds the dist version of the projects (with minified assets)
